# MiRo-e Capstone: C.A.R.E. Project  
### *Child Anxiety Relief Experience*

Welcome to the **MiRo-E Social Robot Project** repository! This capstone project explores the therapeutic potential of **MiRo-E**, a commercially available robot developed by [Consequential Robotics](https://consequentialrobotics.com/miroe), in pediatric healthcare environments.

Our goal is to design an **interactive, non-pharmacological tool** to help alleviate anxiety in young patients using personalized, engaging activities.


## üß† Project Overview

The **C.A.R.E. Project** is focused on creating a supportive experience for pediatric patients by using MiRo-E to guide them through:

- **Guided Breathing Exercises**
- **Muscle Relaxation Activities**
- **Audiobook Storytelling**
- **Dance & Movement Games**

These therapeutic activities are designed to reduce anxiety and can be triggered through multiple input methods:
- **QR/ARUCO Codes**
- **Voice Commands**
- **Remote Control Interface**

## ü§ñ MiRo-E Features

MiRo-E is equipped with multiple sensors that allow it to perceive and respond to its environment. Key features include:

### üéØ Interactive LED Color Modes

- **Blue** ‚Äì Idle exploration mode  
  - MiRo looks around curiously  
  - Responds to touch on head/back  
  - Ears and tail can be gently crinkled  

- **Green** ‚Äì Face detection active

- **Yellow** ‚Äì Listening mode (triggered after hearing ‚ÄúMiRo‚Äù for 10 seconds)

### üé≠ Activity Modes
